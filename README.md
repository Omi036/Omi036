## 🙍‍♂️ About me
I'm a self-taught developer in Spain focused on Computer Science for ~3 years.  
I was surrounded by computers my whole life, until I discovered the amazing world of programming at the age of 11 years old,
making batch scripts in windows. Time later, I decided to learn how to "really" program... and ended up on python becoming my main hobby!
All my friends find it stressful, however, I like having to develop work-around and invest time to solve a problem or a script error.
